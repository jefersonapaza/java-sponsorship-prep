// üî¥ Why it's bad:
//
// 1. The 'cache' list is declared as static.
//    This means it lives as long as the class is loaded in memory.
//
// 2. The list never gets cleared or removed.
//    All the elements added to it will stay in memory forever.
//
// 3. The elements are still referenced inside the static list.
//    Because of this, the Garbage Collector (GC) cannot remove them.
//
// ‚ûú This creates a memory leak:
//    Memory is used but never freed, so it grows and grows over time.
